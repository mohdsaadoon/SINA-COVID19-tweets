Project Description:

This project was a collaborative effort to analyze the discourse around COVID-19 on Twitter using network analysis techniques. As the pandemic swept the globe in early 2020, Twitter became a central platform for public conversations and discourse about the virus.

Our team aimed to explore these discussions and provide insights into the behaviour and sentiment of Twitter users regarding COVID-19. We used Python and libraries such as Tweepy, networkx, and Matplotlib to extract and analyze a large dataset of tweets containing COVID-19-related keywords.

Our analysis focused on three specific areas:
* Identifying echo chambers on Twitter, where users interact mainly with people who share their opinions.
+ Discovering that the most central accounts are not always the ones we expect, with 'regular' people leading the discussions with enough activity and tweet engagement.
- Revealing a more nuanced sentiment on COVID-19 than initially thought, with tweets of happiness and surprise also present in the discussions.

The insights gained from our analysis shed light on preconceived notions about the pandemic and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the behaviour and sentiment of Twitter users during this challenging period.

This open-source project is available on GitHub, making it accessible to researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in exploring COVID-19 discourse on social media.
